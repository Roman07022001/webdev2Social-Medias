<div class="tik"><h2>TikTok has changed the game for social media. It is a platform much like Instagram but JUST videos. Many people believe TikTok is brand new, but in actual fact its been around for much longer. TikTok actually was once a well known app Musical.ly but changed its name to TikTok in August 2018.The brand owner of Musical.ly decided it would be better to merge its community with those of TikTok to gain a better recognition within the industry. The decision was certainly a good one as now TikTok is worth over a
whopping 80 BILLION.TikTok is fastly becoming one of the most used APPS on the app store. One of the main reasons is because of its analytics. A user may go onto instagram and receive maybe 4/5k views on their work, but on TikTok, their work is reaching numbers by the millions.</h2>

TikTok is also available as a website but you cannot create an account this way.</h2>
